TicTacToe game with computer agents

Based on code presented in YouTube video Python TIC TAC TOE Tutorial | Beginner Friendly Tutorial by Code Coach  
Source code availiable at https://github.com/watsojar/tictactoe/blob/main/tictactoePart1Finished.py  

Not finished.  
Fixed several logical errors in tutorial code, including no handling of when an occupied space is chosen.  
Tie games are still not registering correctly.  

Planned extensions of existing code:  
Menu  
Unit testing  
Tracking statistics in read/write file  
Organize in separate modules  
Different cpu agents of varying difficulty  
Ability to choose to play X's or O's
